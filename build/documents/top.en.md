## About the RDF portal
The RDF portal is a data portal developed and operated by DBCLS with the aim of comprehensively collecting RDF datasets provided by a diverse range of life science databases. Initially, it started as a service to accept data submissions from research projects funded by the National Bioscience Database Center (NBDC)'s Database Integration Coordination Program (DICP). However, it has since expanded to include publicly available open RDF datasets in life sciences from around the world. It has now grown into one of the world's leading collections of life science RDF data. Additionally, it functions as a foundational data system for various database services operated by DBCLS.

## Submitting your RDF dataset

The RDF portal accepts submissions of RDF data. The data that can be submitted is limited to RDFized knowledge bases in the field of life sciences. RDF data that only represents raw data produced by experimental instruments is not eligible for submission.

When submitting, in addition to the RDF files, a series of configuration files in the YAML format following the specifications of RDF-config (**https://github.com/dbcls/rdf-config**) need to be provided.

RDF data submitted to the RDF portal undergoes a review process by the RDF portal team. The review assesses whether the RDF data meets the requirements outlined in the DBCLS guidelines for RDFizing databases ( https://github.com/dbcls/rdfizing-db-guidelines ). If you agree to have your data reviewed, please contact via https://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/contact.html
