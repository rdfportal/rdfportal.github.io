## Submitting a RDF dataset

Currently, the NBDC RDF portal only accepts submissions from research groups in Japan due to the limitations of human and mechanical resources.

The requirements are RDF file(s), a metadata entry sheet, schema diagram(s) and sample SPARQL queries. Only openly available RDF dataset is accepted. In addition, it is necessary to correspond to NBDC's RDF review process. First of all, if you want to submit the RDF dataset, please contact rdf-portal @ integbio.jp.
